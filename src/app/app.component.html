                  <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
                    Debt counselling is one of the debt relief measures available in South Africa, introduced by the
                    National Credit Act (NCA) in 2007. Debt counselling is intended to assist over-indebted consumers
                    struggling with debt through budget advice, negotiation with credit providers for reduced payments
                    and
                    restructuring of debts.
                    This is a great process for anyone with an income and struggling to meet their monthly obligations.

                    Over-indebtedness occurs when a consumer is unable to repay all financial obligations in a timely
                    manner
                    and/or where total debt repayments exceed net income (“take-home pay”) after living expenses have
                    been
                    paid for.

                      We provide tailor-made Debt Review Services across South Africa and can help you save money every

                      Through poor financial decision-making or even via no fault of their own, most consumers have lived
                      through the predicament of running out of money before month end, skipping debt repayments to credit
                      providers as a result.
                      The Debt Review Process prevents credit providers from taking legal action against you in order to
                      reclaim the outstanding balance. With our Debt Review Help, you will avoid setting off a grim
                      sequence
                      of ramifications.

              <h4 class="mat-h4">
                Your debt counsellor will work out how much of your income should be set aside for basic living
                expenses, and what you can afford to pay towards your debts each month. Then they will draw up a new,
                more affordable repayment plan for you.
                Next, they will negotiate with your creditors to extend the amount of time you have to repay your debts
                and to have your payments reduced, so you can realistically afford them.
                If all of your creditors agree to the repayment proposal, your debt counsellor will then get a consent
                order from the magistrate’s court or National Consumer Tribunal (NCT).
                All of Debt Angels third party professional debt counsellors are highly qualified and registered with
                the National Credit Regulator (NCR). You can be rest assured that you will be receiving the best service
                possible.
