    <p class="text-center w-responsive mx-auto mb-5">Debt counselling is a process that is intended to help restructure
      the debt obligations of consumers who cannot pay their debts. A consumer will have to involve a debt counsellor
      who will negotiate the restructuring of a consumer's debt obligations with his/her credit providers. The purpose
      of debt counselling is to assist consumers in meeting their debt commitments. Debt counselling was introduced by
      the National Credit Act (NCA) in 2007</p>

      <p>Debt counselling is one of the debt relief measures available in South Africa, introduced by the
        National Credit Act (NCA) in 2007. Debt counselling is intended to assist over-indebted consumers
        struggling with debt through budget advice, negotiation with credit providers for reduced payments
        and
        restructuring of debts.
        This is a great process for anyone with an income and struggling to meet their monthly obligations.</p>

      <h3 class="font-weight-bold mb-3"><strong>1. What is over-indebtedness?</strong></h3>
      <p>A consumer is over-indebted when he/she does not have the means to meet all his/her debt payments at the end of
        a month.
        The Act also states that if the Debt Counsellor has completed an assessment and has reached a conclusion
        that a consumer will not be able to meet his/her debt commitments at the end of a month,
        that consumer is overindebted.

        <br><br>Debt Counsellors also assist consumers with basic financial planning skills, such as drawing up a
        budget.
        Although a consumer has the right to apply for debt restructuring, this does not mean that he /she will
        automatically qualify for the service. After assessing the consumer's financial status,
        a Debt Counsellor may conclude that the consumer is not over-indebted.
        The Debt Counsellor must then issue the consumer with a letter of rejection.
        A consumer who has received such a letter of rejection may, within 20 business days,
        approach the court and request it to declare him/her over-indebted.
